    <string name="desc_1">Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as \"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world\". The painting\'s novel qualities include the subject\'s enigmatic expression, monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.\n\nThe painting has been definitively identified to depict Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family, and it is believed he later left it in his will to his favored apprentice Salaì. It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic. It has been on permanent display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.\n\nThe painting\'s global fame and popularity stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism—a belief it should belong to Italy. The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Arsène Lupin) and the song Mona Lisa recorded by Nat King Cole—one of the most successful songs of the 1950s.\n\nThe Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known painting insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962, equivalent to $1 billion as of 2023.</string>

    <string name="desc_2">The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village. It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Widely regarded as Van Gogh\'s magnum opus, The Starry Night is one of the most recognizable paintings in Western art.</string>

    <string name="desc_3">The painting is a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century description of a \"head\" that was not meant to be a portrait. It depicts a European girl wearing \"exotic dress\", an \"oriental turban\", and what appears to be a very large pearl as an earring. The subject of the painting is unknown, with it either being possible that she was a real model, or that Vermeer created a more generalised and mysterious woman, perhaps representing a Sibyl or biblical figure. There has been speculation that she is the artist\'s eldest daughter, Maria, though this has been dismissed as an anachronism by some art historians.\n\nThe work is oil on canvas and is 44.5 cm (17.5 in) high and 39 cm (15 in) wide. It is signed \"IVMeer\" but not dated. It is estimated to have been painted around 1665.\n\nAfter the most recent restoration of the painting in 1994, the subtle colour scheme and the intimacy of the girl\'s gaze toward the viewer have been greatly enhanced. During the restoration, it was discovered that the dark background, today somewhat mottled, was originally a deep enamel-like green. This effect was produced by applying a thin transparent layer of paint—a glaze—over the black background seen now. However, the two organic pigments of the green glaze, indigo and weld, have faded. In 2014, Dutch astrophysicist Vincent Icke raised doubts about the material of the earring and argued that it looks more like polished tin than pearl on the grounds of the specular reflection, the pear shape and the large size of the earring.</string>
